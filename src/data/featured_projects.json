        "AtHome focused on managing smart home environments and resolving social smart device and Internet of Things conflicts in the general household environment. By using crowd-sourced configurations as templates that are simulated, scored and automatically applied to home environments, the homeowners donâ€™t have to configure every device in their home themselves. Users are able to create configurations by using an easy to use visual programming interface, giving them access to simple tools that can create complex automation behaviour."

We create interactive light installations that make people part of the experience. By utilising a modular concept for the installation parts, we ensure that we can create a custom experience for any event and do not have to reinvent every installation. We craft custom experiences specific to each event with its own sound, interactivity and light experience.",
